# TakeMeAway iOS Client

This repository contains the almost complete source for the TakeMeAway iOS app. This code will not actually compile as it is missing some components. In addition, for this code to run you need to have access to a running [TakeMeAway API](https://github.com/apcro/TakeMeAway-Website). This app uses the [Co-ordinator pattern](https://khanlou.com/2015/01/the-coordinator/).

This source code is provided as an example of an iOS client implementation for a swipeable travel destination selector, with additional methods around information presentation, hotel selection and the booking user journey.
